# Mentee CLI
This is a simple CLI that can CRUD mentees from a local SQLite database. In addition,
the CLI allows you to query the database for totals or averages of various fields.

## Why?
I've built this CLI purely to learn the basics of building a Rust CLI. I have learnt 
a lot getting the project to this stage, and there's plenty more features I would like
to have added. However, there are other unfinished side projects I need to attend to.

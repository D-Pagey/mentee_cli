## To Do
- [ ] How to run using the name e.g. `mentee` rather than `cargo run`? currently building to `target/debug` then running it like `./mentee_cli`
- [ ] `default_value_t` why `t`?
- [ ] Create dummy data const and compile
- [ ] Render a table
- [ ] Check all videos for tips
- [ ] how to set the word that calls the CLI in the terminal? `cargo install`?
- [ ] just running `mentees` should show help subcommand, same for `mentees create`
